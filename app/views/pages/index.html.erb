    <p>Welcome to the 2013 NHL Playoff Pool. All entries must be submitted online before 
    <%= Time.parse(ENV['SUBMISSION_DEADLINE']).in_time_zone('Eastern Time (US & Canada)').strftime("%B %-d, %Y at %l:%M %p")%> through this website.  Submitting entries past that time are blocked from processing, so please don't leave it until the last minute to submit.  When completing the form you must ensure that you have made arrangements for your entry fee to be paid.  If not, your name and entry will be removed from the pool.</p>

    <h1>The playoffs are over!</h1>
    <p>With the 2013 Stanley Cup awarded to the Chicago Blackhawks the end of the Playoff Pool has been reached. Congratulations to each of the entrants that have finished in the money – as per normal practice we will hold off disbursing the funds until the NHL has published their final statistics. This avoids any conflicts if there turns out to be any adjustments to player point totals. In most years the final updates are available within the week following the final game.
    </p><p> 
     For those entrants that are tied the prize money is rolled up and then split equally (i.e. two people tied in 3rd would split the 3rd and 4th place winnings).
     Thanks everyone for participating in this year’s pool and I look forward to seeing you all again next year!</p>
