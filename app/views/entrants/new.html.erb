      <h1 class="page-header">Submit Entry</h1>
      <p>Each entry costs $20 and you may submit multiple entries.  To submit, follow the requirements guide on the right hand side of this page.  As you complete requirements, they will be marked in green.  Once all requirements are satisfied, you will be able to submit your entry.  In the pool, players earn one point per goal and one point per assist.  Goaltenders by team earn two points for the win and two points per shutout, plus one point per goal or assist.</p>
      <p>For your goalie pick, any goalie that plays for that team during the playoffs will have their respective points counted for your picks.  The mulligan man column is the only pick that breaks the "one player per team" rule.  You can pick this player from any team that you'd like, except where you have chosen the goalie.</p>
